This was a fun challenge I did to recreate some key elements of jQuery.  I have used the library for my own personal use as well when I don't need the full jQuery.  It has all the standard syntaxual nuance of jQuery.  Up to and including using the $ as a selector.  It has ajax functionality as well.
